NxTek will ensure security by providing an online examination system saving the cost of transportation, and putting an stop to the leak.
<h3>Making a Real Difference</h3>
The examination system consists of an server which stores all the question, from which an exam paper is randomly generated prior to the exam time, the exam can be taken online and printed for the class. The professor is responsible for submitting the questions to the server using the webpage, which are verified by their superior, two days before the exam the professor would request for question paper using client application, the server will generate an exam but would not release till a few hours prior to the exam, this ensures that the server will not be overloaded on the exam day.
